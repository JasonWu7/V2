                    <strong>Mental Health Disorders and Depression</strong>
            are critical aspects of the human experience that significantly impact individuals' lives, affecting their
            emotional and psychological well-being. These conditions encompass a wide range of mental health challenges,
            each with its unique characteristics and effects.

                        The visualized data is sourced from <strong>Kaggle</strong> and presents data on patients with
            mental health

                    <strong>As of 2017</strong>, the global population affected by mental health issues reached a
                    staggering <strong>801,321,216</strong> people,
                    and mental health problems are prevalent in countries worldwide. <br /><br /><strong>Sweden, Germany, and Finland</strong>
                    are three countries that prioritize mental health issues, allocating a higher proportion of their national 
                    budgets to mental health care. However, this doesn't necessarily mean they have the fewest mental health patients. 
                    On the contrary, their emphasis on mental health likely results in more accurate diagnosis and reporting of mental 
                    health patients, which may lead to slightly higher data. 
                    <br/><br/>In contrast, <strong>China</strong> lags behind in mental health education, 
                    outreach, and funding compared to many other countries, potentially resulting in data that underestimates the 
                    actual values.

                    Environmental factors can also impact mental health, for example, <strong>Greenland</strong> experiences several months of 
                    polar day and polar night each year. This significantly affects people's circadian rhythms, daily routines, 
                    and living conditions, making it a major contributing factor to the high prevalence of mental health disorders among the 
                    local population.<br /><br />
                    The global number of individuals with mental disorders amounts to <strong>10.6%</strong> of the
                    world's total population,
                    meaning that <strong>one in every ten</strong> people has experienced or is currently experiencing
                    challenges related to mental health.

                    In extensive research within the field of mental health, a common phenomenon emerges: <strong style="color: rgb(212,35,122);">women</strong>
                        <strong>are more prone to mental
                        health issues than </strong><strong style="color: rgb(18,150,219);">men</strong>.
                    It is attributed to complex factors, such as biological elements, differences in the
                    physiological makeup of
                    males and females, the impact of hormonal fluctuations on emotions and mental health. For instance,
                    psychological
                    factors play a role, as women tend to be more emotionally oriented, and social factors,
                    such as gender inequality in certain regions, also contribute to this trend.

                    You may be puzzled by the trend chart above, but as the information displayed on the chart indicates, for 
                    most countries, <strong>the proportion of patients with mental health problems has not increased with the growth of 
                    years and population. Instead, it remains in a fluctuating state.</strong> The factors behind this are intricate and complex.
                    The reasons for reducing the number of patients include improved living conditions brought about by economic and 
                    technological development, a growing global focus on mental health issues, and the provision of relevant support.

            <div class="col">
                <div class="intro">
                    On the other hand, the reasons for increasing the number of patients include work-related stress caused by 
                    intensifying competition and a greater awareness of mental health issues, leading more people to seek help and 
                    provide more data for recording.
    
                    <br/>
                    In conclusion, the influencing factors can be diverse, including factors such as war, economy, environment, 
                    cultural background, and natural disasters, all of which have the potential to affect the fluctuation in the 
                    number of individuals with mental health issues.

                    The chart on the left displays the top ten countries with the highest number of mental health issue
                    patients,
                    standardized for comparison. <br/><br/>
                    Upon comparison, there is not a significant difference in the number of patients between most neighboring 
                    countries. The overall data does not exhibit striking extremes to suggest that certain countries have a 
                    significantly higher number of patients. <br/><br/>
                    When looking at the distribution, patients with different categories 
                    of mental disorders show slightly different patterns, with most following a very similar linear or exponential 
                    distribution. <br/><br/>
                    Overall, the distribution of patients globally is relatively uniform. This implies that <Strong>mental health issues 
                    have a certain universality across different cultures and geographical backgrounds</Strong>, and they are not confined 
                    by national borders, capable of occurring on a global scale.

                    Not only is the overall proportion of patients with mental disorders generally maintained within a specific range, 
                    but the proportions of patients with various types of mental health issues also tend to remain stable.<br/><br/>

                    <Strong>Anxiety Disorders and Depression patients make up the majority</Strong>, not only because they are extremely common 
                    mental disorders themselves, but also because they encompass a wide range of issues such as social anxiety, 
                    separation anxiety, panic, feelings of helplessness, and depression, among others. <br/><br/>
                    
                    <strong>In contrast, there are 
                    fewer patients with Schizophrenia and Eating Disorders.</strong> This is partly because they specifically describe 
                    particular symptoms, resulting in a narrower range of coverage. 
                    Schizophrenia has a relatively lower incidence 
                    compared to other categories,

                    yet it is one of the most severe mental health issues, causing patients to 
                    experience hallucinations, delusions, and even impacting their lifespan directly. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Eating disorders mainly 
                    manifest in terms of eating behaviors, such as anorexia or binge eating. The lower number of patients in the 
                    data is partly due to the fact that their symptoms may not receive adequate attention, and this issue often 
                    occurs in adolescents or children, with parents attributing it to picky eating or growth phases.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    Although certain categories may involve more severe symptoms, no mental health problem, no matter how small, 
                    should be ignored. They can impair concentration, induce feelings of pessimism, negativity, and even lead to 
                    suicidal tendencies. They can also have a direct impact on physical health.
