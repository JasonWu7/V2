            <strong>Mental Health Disorders and Depression</strong>
            are critical aspects of the human experience that significantly impact individuals' lives, affecting their
            emotional and psychological well-being. These conditions encompass a wide range of mental health challenges,
            each with its unique characteristics and effects. <strong>Understanding these issues is essential to provide
                support,
                reduce stigma, and improve the overall mental health of individuals and communities.</strong>
            <br /><br />The visualized data is sourced from <strong>Kaggle</strong> and presents data on patients with
            mental health
            issues from different
            countries from <strong>1990 to 2017</strong>.

                    <strong>As of 2017</strong>, the global population affected by mental health issues reached a
                    staggering <strong>801,321,216</strong> people,
                    and mental health problems are prevalent in countries worldwide. <br /><br />From the map,
                    it is evident that countries like <strong>China, the United States, and India</strong> have
                    significantly higher
                    numbers of mental health issue patients compared to other countries.
                    <br /><em>(Note: The visualization data has been standardized, so the number of patients is not
                        directly
                        related to the total population of each country.)</em> <br /><br />Equally noteworthy is that
                    <strong>Greenland</strong> has much
                    lower numbers of mental health issue patients compared to almost all other countries.

                    meaning that <strong>one in every ten</strong> people has experienced or is currently experiencing

                    In extensive research within the field of mental health, a common phenomenon emerges: <strong>women
                        are more prone to mental
                        health issues than men</strong>. This phenomenon is also evident in our data.

                    This phenomenon is attributed to complex factors, such as biological elements, differences in the
                    physiological makeup of
                    males and females, the impact of hormonal fluctuations on emotions and mental health. For instance,
                    psychological
                    factors play a role, as women tend to be more emotionally oriented, and social factors,
                    such as gender inequality in certain regions, also contribute to this trend.

                    The chart on the left displays the top ten countries with the highest number of mental health issue
                    patients,
                    standardized for comparison. The value of top five countries are highlighted for additional
                    emphasis. As mentioned earlier,
                    countries such as China, India, the United States, and North America have the highest number of
                    individuals with
                    mental health disorders, with <strong>China leading by overwhelming numbers in almost all types of
                        mental health issues</strong>.
                    The chart allows us to compare that while these countries all have a significant number of patients,
                    the difference
                    in numbers among them is particularly substantial.
                    <br /><br />
                    From an overall trend perspective, the <strong>data follows an exponential distribution</strong>.
                    This implies that certain countries
                    have significantly more mental health issue patients than others, and the majority of these patients
                    may originate
                    from specific regions. The reasons behind such significant disparities could be cultural
                    differences, such as a
                    lack of emphasis on mental health and education, or environmental factors, like high competition and
                    stress in
                    densely populated areas.
